[[Other/Telegram Sync\|Telegram Sync]] is an Obsidian Community Extension. It allows for adding content to an Obsidian Vault right from the Telegram app (which is a messenger app, similar to WhatsApp).

The way to set it up is to start a conversation in [[Telegram\|Telegram]] with the "BotFather" bot. You can then ask it to create you a bot, and that bot gets an API token.

You then navigate back to Obsidian and to the [[Other/Telegram Sync\|Telegram Sync]] extension, and configure it to use that API token. It also gives you various options of how it should deal with new content, and it lets you choose a template that is then used to render new messages.

Because I didn't like the way it created new filenames, I choose to let it append new content to one specific file.

A more detailed explanation can be found in the extension itself.
