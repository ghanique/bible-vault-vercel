# Conventions

Created: 2022-04-24 15:30  

## Conventions for Scriptures

The `Scripture` directory contains `Translations`, `Books`, and `Chapters`. I choose to:

- only create a `Translation` if there is a `note` using that `Translation`,
- only create a `Book` if there is a `note` that uses that `Book`,
- only create a `Chapter` if there is a `note` using a `Verse` from that `Chapter`, and
- only create a `Verse` if there is a `note` using that `Verse`.

However,

- When I create a `Book`, I do let it list *all* that `Book`s Chapters. So many links will be greyed out, because the respective `Article` for that `Chapter` doesn't exist yet.
- When I create a `Chapter`, I do add *all* the `placeholders` for that `Chapter`'s' `Verses`, even if not all `Verses` have `Articles`. So many times it will say something like "Genesis 2.1 KJV" is not created yet. Click to create.", but where Articles exist, it will show the `Verse`'s content.

## Conventions when writing Notes

A `Note` is a thought on a `bible Verse` or a combination of `Verses`. When writing a `Note`, whenever one runs into `Concept`, `Place` or `Person`, that word is supposed to be put between brackets. This creates a link to an `Article`that doesn't exist yet. Click that link to create that `Article`. That `Article` will be created in the root of this Vault.

After creating the `Article` one can either leave it blank and leave it in the root folder, so that it can be given content at a later date, or one can create the content and move it to the respective folder, indicating that the `Article` has been written.

In `Notes` one will typically use `Verses`. If `Concepts`, `Places`, or `Persons` are detected in those verses, go to the `Verse Article` and put the terms in Brackets, and create the respective article if it hasn't been created yet.
