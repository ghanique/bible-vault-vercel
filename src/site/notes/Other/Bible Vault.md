## Introduction

Welcome to the `Bible Vault`! It is *the* place to create notes about what you learn from the [[Concepts/Bible\|Bible]]. It is based on the [Zettelkasten System](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/). It can inherently grow with you as you learn more.

But it's more. The Vault is also based on the idea that Notes are not just information that can be understood by a human, but that it can be data at the same time, which can be understood by a computer. This makes the `Bible Vault` an invaluable tool to find new truths, enhance your understanding, or simply help you to compose the next sermon or Bible study.

This document will start by explaining the `Artifacts` that make up the framework that powers the Vault. Once you understand the basics, it will show you how to use the tool. All this should be an easy read and enough to get you going.

For those that want to know more, there is also an Advanced section, that describes the details of how the Vault works. It will also describe a technique called [[Other/Bible Vault#Triadic Closures\|#Triadic Closures]], which can help you to find more hidden meaning.

Nothing is perfect. The `Bible Vault` is no exception. The last section will list some things that could or should be improved. If you are able to assist, any help is greatly appreciated. If not, just wait for future updates :-).
