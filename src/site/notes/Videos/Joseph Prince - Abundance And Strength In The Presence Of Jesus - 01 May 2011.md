## Transcript

Little becomes much in the presence of Jesus. Amen. Many of us say the Lord never leaves us nor forsakes us, but are we practicing His presence? Are we conscious He’s with us? Faith is the greatest of all the graces; you need to believe that He loves you, actively loves you, and loves you now. Amen.

When God raised us from the dead in Christ, He put us in Christ, close to the Father at His right hand. But how many know we all need to draw near to Jesus? That's different. Not every disciple is near to Jesus. Peter, although a disciple, felt distant from the Lord because he boasted of his love. He had to signal over to John, nearer to Jesus, to ask who would betray Him. John asked the Lord, and the Lord told John. Even though all were disciples, there were 70 disciples, then 12, and then three: Peter, James, and John. Among these three, there was John, not because he had special favor with Jesus, but because he knew and practiced the presence and love of Jesus.

Are you conscious the Lord loves you? Are you conscious of His presence? Do you talk to Him? Do you see Him with you all the time? In His presence, little becomes much. Amen. Whether it’s your business, finances, or even souls you’re believing God to add to the kingdom, little becomes much when you’re conscious of His presence. Amen. He is here now. Praise the Lord. He is right where you are. Practice His presence. Amen.

Thank you, Jesus. Now watch this. Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish which you have just caught.” He didn't cook the fish; He gave them the little fish. Jesus took the bread and gave it, likewise the single small fish. Then, He told them to bring the big catch they had caught. Simon Peter went up and dragged the net to land, full of large fish, [[Numbers/Number 153\|153]], and although there were so many, the net was not broken. In Luke 5, the net broke, but this time, in the resurrected presence of Jesus, no nets broke. Amen.

Church, Simon Peter went up and dragged the net. Earlier, seven men couldn't draw it in, but one man, close to Jesus, had the power to draw the entire catch by himself. Why? In the presence of Jesus, little becomes much, weakness becomes strength, disease becomes health, and life. Hallelujah. This is wonderful. Hallelujah. Just preach myself happy. Amen.

There are times I feel this strength on Sunday. Usually, I sleep the least the night before, about four or five hours. My mind is active, still preparing. Nighttime is the best time for me to spend with the Lord. On Sunday, I get very few hours of sleep but have a strength and energy from within when I start preaching. It gets stronger and stronger, even after the service is over. When I go out with my pastors, they are sleepy while I am strong. The pastors will tell you that I find it hard to sleep on Sunday night because I feel so alive. Pastors, leaders, don’t shun the pulpit. Don’t see it as a place that drains you. It’s a place of empowerment. Amen. The more you preach, even when you’re weak, life is released. You can preach your way back into life, health, and wholeness. Hallelujah. Amen.

When I don't preach, I sometimes feel blah or have a headache. Any ministry will be draining if you're not doing it for the Lord. This was done in the presence of Jesus. Hallelujah. One man, in physical strength, could draw the entire net full of great fishes, [[Numbers/Number 153\|153]] types. There were more fish in the net. Why [[Numbers/Number 153\|153]]? There’s no insignificant detail in the Bible. Numbers have meanings. 

- [[Numbers/Number 1\|Number 1]] is unity, 
- [[Numbers/Number 2\|number 2]] is agreement, 
- [[Numbers/Number 3\|number 3]] is resurrection, 
- [[Numbers/Number 4\|Number 4]] is earth (four corners, four winds), 
- [[Numbers/Number 5\|number 5]] is grace. The fifth time Noah’s name was mentioned, it says Noah found grace. 
- [[Numbers/Number 6\|6]] is man, [[Numbers/Number 666\|666]] is man without God. 
- [[Numbers/Number 7\|Number 7]] is [[Concepts/Perfection\|perfection]] or [[Concepts/Rest\|Rest]], 
- [[Numbers/Number 8\|Number 8]] is new beginning, 
- [[Numbers/Number 9\|Number 9]] is the number of the Holy Spirit (nine gifts, nine fruits), 
- and [[Numbers/Number 10\|Number 10]] is ordinal completion.

[[Numbers/Number 17\|Seventeen]] is significant in this [[Numbers/Number 153\|153]]. [[Numbers/Number 17\|Seventeen]] in the Bible is a number of victory. [[Scripture/KJV/Genesis KJV/Genesis 8 KJV/Genesis 8.4 KJV\|Genesis 8:4]] tells us the [[Concepts/Ark (boat)\|ark]] [[Concepts/Rest\|Rested]] on the [[Numbers/Number 17\|seventeenth]] day of the [[Numbers/Number 7\|seventh]] month on the Mountains of [[Locations/Ararat\|Ararat]]. This is exactly the day Jesus rose from the dead. The Jewish people tell us the [[Concepts/Ark (boat)\|ark]] rested on the Feast of First Fruits, three days after Passover. The [[Concepts/Ark (boat)\|ark]] rested the same day Jesus rose. Amen. The [[Numbers/Number 17\|seventeenth]] day of the [[Numbers/Number 7\|seventh]] month. It rested on the Mountains of Ararat. Ararat in Hebrew means the curse is reversed. When Jesus rose from the dead, and we are in Him, we are on ground where the curse is reversed. Amen. You don’t live under the curse. Your friends or colleagues may say, “This is life,” when bad things happen. Not your life, not my life. We are on life where the curse is reversed. Hallelujah. We are on favor ground, resurrection ground, curse-reversed ground. Praise God.

[[Numbers/Number 17\|Seventeen]], number of victory. Jeremiah prayed [[Numbers/Number 17\|17]] prayers in the Old Testament. The [[Numbers/Number 17\|17th]] prayer was when God told him to buy land in a place called Anathoth, which means “answered prayer.” He bought the field for [[Numbers/Number 17\|17]] shekels of silver. [[Numbers/Number 17\|Seventeen]], number of victory. In the Hebrew Bible, there are four books of Psalms. The last two, Leviticus and Deuteronomy, each have [[Numbers/Number 17\|17]] Psalms. Leviticus is about worship, Numbers is about walking in the earth below. Both worship and your walk before God are marked with victory. Amen.

Romans 8: “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?” This love that loves us actively. Shall tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, sword? For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God. [[Numbers/Number 17\|Seventeen]], number of victory. Hallelujah. Your Bible is an inspired book. Your Bible is God-breathed.
