Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the cities great and fenced: if so be[^1] the LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.

[^1]: In the original Hebrew there is no uncertainty here. It was better translated with "since". (See [[Books/Give me this Mountain#Day 1 Give Me this Mountain\|Give me this Mountain#Day 1 Give Me this Mountain]]).
