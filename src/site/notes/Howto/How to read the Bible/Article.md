"A" and "the" are both articles in English language, but they are used in different ways. "The" is a definite article that refers to something specific that usually has been mentioned before. "A" is an indefinite article that refers to any of a group of similar things, not to a specific thing.

Whether "the" is used, or "a" is used, or the article is omitted, can significantly change the meaning of a sentence. For example, the implications of being made righteous versus being made *the righteousness of God*, are significantly different.
