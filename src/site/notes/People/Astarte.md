[[People/Astarte\|Astarte]] is an evil godess. The [[Locations/Canaan\|Canaanites]] called her [[People/Astarte\|Asherah]], where she is the mother of fertility, love, and motherhood. With other peoples she was also the god of war, or beauty.

There is some noise as to whether she was [[People/Baal\|Baal]]'s wife or sister, but mostly she is considered his wife.
