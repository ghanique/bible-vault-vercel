Usually referring to the [[Concepts/Man (Person)\|man]], as in [[People/Adam\|Adam]] and [[People/Eve\|Eve]]. However, in [[Scripture/KJV/Genesis KJV/Genesis 5 KJV/Genesis 5.2 KJV\|Genesis 5.2 KJV]] [[People/Adam\|Adam]] is referring to both the [[Concepts/Man (Person)\|man]] and the [[Concepts/Woman\|woman]].

[[People/Adam\|Adam]] is recorded as the one who sinned first. This could strike as weird if technically [[People/Eve\|Eve]] was the first to eat the forbidden fruit, unless one considers that [[People/Adam\|Adam]] could also refer to both of them.
