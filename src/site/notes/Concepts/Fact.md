If a [[Concepts/Truth\|Truth]] is something that was always [[Concepts/Truth\|True]], is [[Concepts/Truth\|True]] now, and always will be [[Concepts/Truth\|True]] (like 2+2=4), and a [[Concepts/Lie\|Lie]] is something that was always [[Concepts/Lie\|False]], is [[Concepts/Lie\|False]] now, and always will be [[Concepts/Lie\|False]] (like 2+2=5), then a [[Concepts/Fact\|Fact]] (like we're living in the 2020's) is neither [[Concepts/Truth\|Truth]] nor a [[Concepts/Lie\|Lie]], because 10 years ago we weren't, now we are, and in 10 years we won't.

That means that a [[Concepts/Fact\|Fact]] is a temporary situation that is subject to change.
