We haven't just receive [[Concepts/Grace\|Grace]] as a one time deal. We have received [[Concepts/Grace\|Grace]] for [[Concepts/Grace\|Grace]], meaning that the moment we "consume" [[Concepts/Grace\|Grace]], immediately it is replaced with more [[Concepts/Grace\|Grace]].

When does this end? Never, because [[Notes/We have received from His fullness\|We have received from His fullness]].
