Through [[Concepts/Faith\|faith]] we understand that the worlds were framed by the [[Concepts/Word of God\|word of God]], so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.

By faith we understand that the world was made by the word of God. God didn't just utter noise. What He spoke was deliberate and coherent: "Let there be light!". So by faith we understand that the world was made deliberately.

By faith we understand that the world was made, and that it was not made by nothing. The physical realm that we can see was created by the spiritual realm that we cannot see. We cannot see the spiritual realm because it doesn't appear in the physical realm, because it's not physical.

Whether you understand that the world was made deliberately, or still think that the world was accidentally made from nothing, are two completely distinct paradigms that affect every area of life and every decision that you will ever make.
