Therefore shall ye lay up these [[Concepts/Word of God\|my words]] in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.

We all know these verses, that we should write the [[Concepts/Word of God\|Word of God]] everywhere. What we often don't know, is why.

## The [[Concepts/Promise\|Promise]]

Why? So that:

1. Our days may be multiplied,
2. Our children's days may be multiplied,
3. That our days should be as the days of [[Concepts/Heaven\|Heaven]], but then upon the [[Concepts/Earth\|Earth]].

Wow! What a [[Concepts/Promise\|Promise]]!

## Tracking back

So, are your days like [[Concepts/Heaven\|heaven]] on [[Concepts/Earth\|earth]]? If the answer is "No", is [[Concepts/Word of God\|God's Word]] always before you? Do you believe the [[Concepts/Word of God\|Word of God]]? Do you apply the [[Concepts/Word of God\|Word of God]]?

But this also means that you can turn your situation around!
