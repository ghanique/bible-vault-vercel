If we consider the statement "[[Concepts/Man (Person)\|Men]] are equal to [[Concepts/Woman\|women]]", then this statement is mostly correct in many scenarios. However, from a mathematical perspective, the statement is [[Concepts/Lie\|false]]. Comparing it to the analogy of three apples and three oranges, although they share similarities such as being fruit and having the same quantity, it is evident that apples and oranges are distinct. This distinction has even become a common saying: "comparing apples to oranges."

## In the Bible

If we explore how the [[Concepts/Woman\|woman]] was created in the [[Concepts/Bible\|Bible]], then it says:


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/scripture/kjv/genesis-kjv/genesis-2-kjv/genesis-2-18-kjv/" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



And the LORD God said, It is not good that the [[Concepts/Man (Person)\|man]] should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.


</div></div>


Although the word for "meet" in this verse doesn't have a [[Other/Strong's\|Strong's]] number associated with it, further research shows that it is the word "k'negdo". "k'negdo" is a compound word of "similar" and "opposite.[^1] Therefore, while [[Concepts/Man (Person)\|men]] and [[Concepts/Woman\|women]] are similar in aspects, they are also each other's opposites.

## In the Natural

[[Scripture/KJV/Romans KJV/Romans 1 KJV/Romans 1.20 KJV\|Romans 1:20]] says:


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/scripture/kjv/romans-kjv/romans-1-kjv/romans-1-20-kjv/" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



For the invisible things of him from the [[Concepts/Creationism\|creation]] of the [[Concepts/Earth\|world]] are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:


</div></div>


Or in other words: we can comprehend the nature of creation by looking at the [[Concepts/Natural\|Natural]] world. When we simply observe [[Concepts/Man (Person)\|men]] and [[Concepts/Woman\|women]], it becomes evident that they are different in many ways. For example: they have a different appearance and they think differently. It's not for nothing that studies have demonstrated that companies where management is comprised of both [[Concepts/Man (Person)\|men]] and [[Concepts/Woman\|women]] are much more successful than business that are predominantly led by [[Concepts/Man (Person)\|men]]. [[Concepts/Woman\|Women]] perceive and evaluate matters differently, leading to distinct decision-making processes. The decisions made by both [[Concepts/Man (Person)\|men]] and [[Concepts/Woman\|women]] tend to be more balanced.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, though [[Concepts/Man (Person)\|men]] and [[Concepts/Woman\|women]] can have many things in common, being equal is not one of them.
