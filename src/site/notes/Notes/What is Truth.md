## Introduction

When [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] said "I came is to this [[Concepts/Earth\|world]] to bear witness to the [[Concepts/Truth\|Truth]]", [[People/Pilate\|Pilate]] asked: "What is [[Concepts/Truth\|Truth]]?"

[[People/Pilate\|Pilate]] therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the [[Concepts/Earth\|world]], that I should bear witness unto the [[Concepts/Truth\|truth]]. Every one that is of the [[Concepts/Truth\|truth]] heareth my voice.

[[People/Pilate\|Pilate]] saith unto [[People/Jesus\|him]], What is [[Concepts/Truth\|truth]]? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the [[Locations/Israel\|Jews]], and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.

## Opinion vs Truth

Now, if I were to ask a group how tall I am, everyone may have a different `opinion`: Some may say I'm 5'8'', others may say I'm 6'.

But as soon as I get myself a tape measure, which is a `standard` for measuring sizes, and it says I'm 5'10'', then immediately everyone's `opinion` of how tall they think I am becomes irrelevant. The [[Concepts/Truth\|Truth]] is: I'm 5'10'', period.

## Removing the Standard

Society was based on the [[Concepts/Word of God\|Word of God]] and it served as a `standard` to distinguish right from wrong. What you see happen today, is that nobody believes that the [[Concepts/Word of God\|Word of God]] is [[Concepts/Truth\|True]] anymore. And by doing so, you basically remove the `standard` to determine what is right and wrong. That also means that things that used to be [[Concepts/Truth\|True]], like "[[Concepts/Male\|male]] and [[Concepts/Female\|female]] He created them" revert to being `opinions`, and that makes things really confusing.
