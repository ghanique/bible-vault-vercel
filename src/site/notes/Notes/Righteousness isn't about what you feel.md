And the [[Concepts/Blood\|blood]] shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the [[Concepts/Blood\|blood]], [[People/God\|I]] will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you , when I smite the land of Egypt.

[[Concepts/Righteousness\|Righteousness]] isn't about whether *you* feel you're worthy of it. It isn't even about whether *you* see the [[Concepts/Blood\|Blood]]. You don't even have to know it's about [[Concepts/Blood\|Blood]]. [[Concepts/Righteousness\|Righteousness]] is about whether **[[People/God\|God]] sees** the [[Concepts/Blood\|Blood]].
