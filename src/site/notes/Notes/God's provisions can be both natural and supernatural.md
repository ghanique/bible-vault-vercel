And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the [[Concepts/Raven\|Raven]]s to feed thee there.

Ravens dropping off food definitely is not natural! Ravens naturally do not *give* food, they *steal* food. So [[People/God\|God]]'s provisions are supernatural.

But one does not only need to eat, one also needs to drink. Drinking from a brook is very natural (for now - though it stopped raining, that doesn't mean that the brook will instantly be dried up).

So [[People/God\|God]]'s provisions are both natural *and* supernatural.

Often we disqualify indications that we are in the right place[^1], because not everything is supernatural. We shouldn't. [[People/God\|God]] also directs natural resources your way.
