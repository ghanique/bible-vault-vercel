[[People/God\|God]] wasn't very specific when He told [[People/Elijah\|Elijah]] to go east. But He was *very* specific on how he would recognize the right spot: there'd be a pile of food.[^1] But that pile of food wasn't visible from where [[People/Elijah\|Elijah]] *was*. *First* he would have to walk in the approximate direction of where [[People/God\|God]] told him to go: "Just start walking eastward".

One tends to wait for a very specific [[Concepts/Word of God\|Word from God]] before you start moving: "I'm not going unless I'm absolutely sure that it is the right thing to do". But that's not how it works. You may not be sure if the option that lies before you is "the right thing". But that option may very well be in the right direction.

If you wait for a very specific [[Concepts/Word of God\|Word from God]] you may never see exactly where you destination is. [[People/God\|God]] will direct your *path*.[^2] But He can only do that *after* you start moving. Are you willing to [[Concepts/Faith\|Trust]] [[People/God\|God]] without knowing exactly where to go?
