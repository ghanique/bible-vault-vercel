Therefore thou art inexcusable, O [[Concepts/Mankind\|man]], whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.

Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of [[People/God\|God]] leadeth thee to repentance?

What [[People/Paul\|Paul]] is saying here is that you have two choices:

1. Live by the [[Concepts/Law\|Law]]
2. Live by Grace

If you choose to Live by [[Concepts/Law\|Law]], you lose. You can blame others for breaking the [[Concepts/Law\|law]], but you, too, break the [[Concepts/Law\|law]], so in the end you will both be [[Concepts/Judgement\|judged]].

The other choice is to Live by [[Concepts/Grace\|Grace]]. [[Concepts/Grace\|Grace]] gives what no one deserves.[^1]

What [[Concepts/Christian\|Christians]] often don't seem to understand, is that one does not run towards someone who [[Concepts/Judgement\|Judges]] you. In fact, the tendency is to run away from someone. So by "Preaching" that people go to [[Concepts/Hell\|Hell]] if they do not pray the [[Concepts/Sinner's Prayer\|Sinner's Prayer]], you are *not* drawing people *towards* [[People/God\|God]], you are driving them *away from* [[People/God\|God]].

[[People/Paul\|Paul]] takes it one step further: if you choose to take path nr 1 (Live by the [[Concepts/Law\|Law]]), you are actually despising [[People/God\|God]]'s, patience, persistence in being good, and the riches of his goodness.

But the new covenant *is* about [[People/God\|God]]'s goodness, and it's that goodness that draws people *towards* [[People/God\|God]] and leads them to repentance.
