> And of his **fulness** have we all received

When we pray, we are not asking [[People/God\|God]] for something that He does not have. He is the source of all that we need. When we receive from [[People/God\|God]], we are receiving from a place of abundance, not scarcity. There is nothing that we could ever need that is not already available to us in His **fullness**.
