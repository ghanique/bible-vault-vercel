And [[People/Elijah\|Elijah]] the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of [[Locations/Gilead\|Gilead]], said unto [[People/Ahab\|Ahab]], As the LORD God of [[Locations/Israel\|Israel]] liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.

> there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to *my* word.

I already made the point that [[People/Elijah\|Elijah]] did not specifically go to [[People/Ahab\|Ahab]] because [[People/God\|God]] told him to.[^1] But it's worse: instead of "it will rain again when God says so", he says "it will rain again when *I* say so!" Talking about "taking authority"!

Obviously [[People/Elijah\|Elijah]] does not have the power to change the weather. No one does, but [[People/God\|God]]. Apparently [[People/God\|God]] made the rain stop, because [[People/Elijah\|Elijah]] said so.

(Later you can see that it is [[People/God\|God]] who is going to make it rain again[^2]).

And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came to [[People/Elijah\|Elijah]] in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto [[People/Ahab\|Ahab]]; and I will send rain upon the [[Concepts/Earth\|earth]].
