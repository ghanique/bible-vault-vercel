This is one interesting verse! It could have said "nobody was feeble". In that sentence "nobody" relates to the group: in the group as a whole nobody is feeble. But in "not one was feeble", "not one" relates to _each and every_ individual in that group. And if you consider that that group has a size of several million people,[^1] then that is _very_ impressive.

This is in a time when [[Concepts/Sin (noun)\|Sin]] was not imputed,[^2] so if it applied to them, then it should certainly apply to us.

## Why do we not see it?

The [[Concepts/Fact\|Fact]] is: this is not what church generally looks like: _many_ are [[Concepts/Feeble\|Feeble]] and _many_ die of [[Concepts/Sickness\|Illnesses]]. Why is that?

[[People/Paul\|Paul]] answers this question explicitly:

For this cause many are [[Concepts/Feeble\|weak]] and [[Concepts/Sickness\|sickly]] among you, and many sleep.


</div></div>


For what cause?

For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh [[Concepts/Curse\|damnation]] to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.


</div></div>


The entire section talks about division between people and that some overindulge causing them to be drunk and others to have nothing. The section also concludes with that people should eat before they eat [[Concepts/Holy Communion\|The Lord's Supper]] so that they "don't come together unto [[Concepts/Curse\|damnation]]".[^3]

There are a few reasons why I don't believe that this behavior is what is causing many to be [[Concepts/Sickness\|Sick]] and [[Concepts/Feeble\|Feeble]], and [[Concepts/Death\|Die]] prematurely.

- The behavior is the broader [[Howto/How to read the Bible/Context\|Context]]. The immediate [[Howto/How to read the Bible/Context\|Context]] is [[Scripture/KJV/1 Corinthians KJV/1 Corinthians 11 KJV/1 Corinthians 11.29 KJV\|1 Corinthians 11.29 KJV]], which is a different [[Howto/How to read the Bible/Context\|Context]].
- In the entire section it is about eating _and_ drinking, hungry _and_ drunken, bread _and_ wine.
