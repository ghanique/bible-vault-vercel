For [[People/Jesus\|he]] hath [[Strongs/G4160\|made]] him to be [[Concepts/Sin (noun)\|sin]] for us, who knew no [[Concepts/Sin (noun)\|sin]]; that we might be [[Strongs/G1096\|made]] the [[Concepts/Righteousness\|Righteousness]] of [[People/God\|God]] in him.

People in the [[Concepts/Old Testament\|Old Testament]] could not approach [[People/God\|God]], because His [[Concepts/Holy\|Holiness]] was blocking His [[Concepts/Love\|Love]].

We *can* approach [[People/God\|God]], because [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]]' sacrifice was the ultimate manifestation of [[Concepts/Love\|Love]] and allowed us to be **the** [[Concepts/Righteousness\|Righteousness]] of [[People/God\|God]], to **be** [[Concepts/Holy\|Holy]] instead of to *do* [[Concepts/Holy\|Holy]].

But we **cannot** approach [[People/God\|God]] with an attitude as if He is *just* [[Concepts/Holy\|Holy]] or *just* [[Concepts/Love\|Love]].
