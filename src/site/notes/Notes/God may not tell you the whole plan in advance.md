And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,


</div></div>


- And [[People/Elijah\|Elijah]] sad unto [[People/Ahab\|Ahab]]
- And (then) the word of the LORD came unto him

The second word of [[People/God\|God]] come only *after* [[People/Elijah\|Elijah]] had acted on the first one.

When [[People/God\|God]] tells you to go and do something, He may not tell you in advance how things will go from there. Only after you obey he may tell you what's coming next.

There are some good reasons why [[People/God\|God]] doesn't tell you the entire plan in advance:

- [[Concepts/Faith\|Faith]] is required for [[People/God\|God]] to work. If you can obey without knowing the plan, you are by definition demonstrating [[Concepts/Faith\|Faith]].
- If [[People/God\|God]] would have told [[People/Elijah\|Elijah]] the whole plan in advance, including letting fire come from [[Concepts/Heaven\|heaven]] like a bolt from the blue, [[People/Elijah\|Elijah]] may have been overwhelmed and not have taken the first step. And if telling the whole plan could cause one to back off, the plan wouldn't get executed, so why tell you?
- If [[People/God\|God]] telling you the whole plan also makes you inherently responsible for executing the plan.
- It's not in [[People/God\|God]]'s nature to tell you the whole plan.[^3]
- You may not be able to comprehend [[People/God\|God]]'s plan.[^4]
- You may get inpatient if [[People/God\|God]] tells you the whole plan. [[People/Moses\|Moses]], as opposed to [[People/Elijah\|Elijah]], did know the entire plan in advance.[^1] He could see himself delivering them, considering his position in Pharaoh's court. In the end this lead him to attempt to deliver them 10 years early, which caused an extra 30 years of slavery.* [^2]
