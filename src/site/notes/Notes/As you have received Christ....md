As ye have therefore received [[People/Jesus\|Christ Jesus]] the Lord, so walk ye in him:


</div></div>


As [[Concepts/Christian\|Christians]] we are typically very open to new believers: "You can come as you are", "[[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] came for sinners (like you)", etc. But as soon as they become a [[Concepts/Christian\|Christian]] we start expecting that they go and conform to certain standards. Continuing committing [[Concepts/Sins (noun)\|sins]], like how they received [[People/Jesus\|Christ]], is no longer acceptable.  

I believe there are two things that are wrong with this picture.  

One is that you didn't become a [[Concepts/Sinner\|sinner]] in the first place by committing [[Concepts/Sins (noun)\|sins]]. You became a [[Concepts/Sinner\|sinner]] because [[People/Adam\|Adam]] sinned, and as a result you [[Concepts/Sin (verb)\|sin]], not the other way around. There was nothing that [[Concepts/Mankind\|man]] can _do_ or not do to not _be_ a [[Concepts/Sinner\|sinner]]. Similarly, when you receive [[People/Jesus\|Christ]] you become [[Notes/We are THE righteousness of God\|The Righteousness of God]], not because of what you did, but because of what [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] did. There is nothing that you can _do_ or not do to not _be_ [[Notes/We are THE righteousness of God\|The Righteousness of God]].  

The other is that permanent change can only happen intrinsically. Any change that is extrinsically is not permanent. Another way to say it is that extrinsic change is not by [[Concepts/Faith\|faith]], and anything that is not out of [[Concepts/Faith\|faith]] is not pleasing to [[People/God\|God]], and temporal. Only what is done out of [[Concepts/Faith\|faith]] is eternal.

Just like there is a tendency to [[Concepts/Sin (verb)\|sin]] when you are a [[Concepts/Sinner\|sinner]] (which is intrinsic), there is a tendency to go and do things out of [[Concepts/Faith\|faith]] when you are [[Notes/We are THE righteousness of God\|The Righteousness of God]].

It doesn't mean that [[Concepts/Sins (noun)\|sins]] aren't destructive. It is. But it does mean that "committing [[Concepts/Sin (verb)\|sin]]" is the wrong metric to monitor one's relationship with [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]]. The correct metric is what one does out of [[Concepts/Faith\|faith]].

As we have received Chris, so should we continue to walk in Him, not trying to change extrinsically, but allowing the [[Concepts/Holy Spirit\|Holy Spirit]] to change us from the inside out.
