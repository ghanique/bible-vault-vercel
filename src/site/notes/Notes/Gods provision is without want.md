It could have said: "The [[Concepts/Raven\|Raven]]s brought [[People/Elijah\|Elijah]] bread and flesh in the morning and in the evening", which would leave some ambiguity to when the [[Concepts/Raven\|Raven]]s brought what.

When [[People/God\|God]] provides, you won't be lacking bread in the morning, or meat in the evening, you will have both.
