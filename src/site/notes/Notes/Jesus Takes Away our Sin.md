The next day [[People/John the Baptist\|John]] seeth [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] coming unto him, and saith, Behold the [[People/Jesus\|Lamb of God]], which taketh away the [[Concepts/Sin (noun)\|sin]] of the [[Concepts/Earth\|world]].

Up to now people had to sacrifice [[Concepts/Blood\|Blood]] to atone for their [[Concepts/Sins (noun)\|Sins]]. "To atone" means "to cover". [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] is different. His sacrifice is NOT an _atonement_ for our [[Concepts/Sins (noun)\|Sins]]. He takes **away** our [[Concepts/Sin (noun)\|Sin]].

I don't believe it ever was about "[[Concepts/Sins (noun)\|Sins]]", the things we're _doing_, but about "[[Concepts/Sin (noun)\|Sin]]", the _nature_, what we _are_, which causes us to commit [[Concepts/Sins (noun)\|Sins]]. Before, [[Concepts/Sin (noun)\|Sin]] (the _nature_) couldn't be taken away, only covered. Not only has [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]]' sacrifice taken aways our [[Concepts/Sins (noun)\|Sins]], but also the cause of it: the [[Concepts/Sin (noun)\|Sin]] nature.
