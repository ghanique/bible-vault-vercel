But when [[People/Peter\|he]] saw the wind boisterous, [[People/Peter\|he]] was afraid; and beginning to sink, [[People/Peter\|he]] cried, saying, Lord, save me.

We all know the story of [[People/Peter\|Peter]] walking on water and eventually sinking. We all share respect for him walking on water in the first place, but most of us are equally disappointed that he "failed" in the end.

But do you notice *when* he sank? If you look closely at verse 31 you will notice that [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] didn't have to move an inch to grab [[People/Peter\|Peter]]. All He had to do, was to stretch forth His hand to catch him.

As long as we are *walking* by [[Concepts/Faith\|Faith]], it's not that hard to look at [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]]. After all, if you are really walking by [[Concepts/Faith\|Faith]] you have no choice but to look at [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]]. But the real danger is when you have arrived: now all of a sudden you have time to look around, and *that* is when you will sink.
