For the [[Concepts/Law\|law]] was given by [[People/Moses\|Moses]], but [[Concepts/Grace\|grace]] and [[Concepts/Truth\|truth]] came by [[People/Jesus\|Jesus Christ]].

Think with me:

- If the [[Concepts/Law\|Law]] was given by [[People/Moses\|Moses]],
	- then the [[Concepts/Law\|Law]] did NOT come by [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]].
- If  the [[Concepts/Law\|Law]] did NOT come by [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] AND ([[Concepts/Grace\|Grace]] and [[Concepts/Truth\|Truth]]) did,
	- then the [[Concepts/Law\|Law]] is NOT ([[Concepts/Grace\|Grace]] and [[Concepts/Truth\|Truth]]).

The [[Concepts/Law\|Law]] is neither [[Concepts/Grace\|Grace]] nor [[Concepts/Truth\|Truth]].

This has a lot of implications on verses that either talk about the [[Concepts/Law\|Law]].
