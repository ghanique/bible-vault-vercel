In [[Scripture/KJV/Genesis KJV/Genesis KJV\|Genesis KJV]] man eats from the [[Concepts/Tree of Knowledge\|Tree of Knowledge]], but they did not eat from the [[Concepts/Tree of Life\|Tree of Life]]. When [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] died on the cross, He **became** the [[Concepts/Tree of Life\|Tree of Life]]. That's why it is so important to eat the bread in the [[Concepts/Holy Communion\|Holy Communion]].
