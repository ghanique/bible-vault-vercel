It could have said: "that me might be made [[Concepts/Righteousness\|righteous]]", for example. But it doesn't. We have not simply been made [[Concepts/Righteousness\|righteous]]. We have been made **the** [[Concepts/Righteousness\|Righteousness]] of [[People/God\|God]], the only kind of [[Concepts/Righteousness\|Righteousness]] that really exists, the only kind of [[Concepts/Righteousness\|Righteousness]] that's really good enough.

[[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] not only made us [[Concepts/Righteousness\|Righteous]], He made us **the [[Concepts/Righteousness\|Righteous]] of [[People/God\|God]]**.
