And he said, O [[People/LORD God\|LORD God]] of my master [[People/Abraham\|Abraham]], I pray thee, send me [[Strongs/H7136\|good speed]] this day, and shew kindness unto my master [[People/Abraham\|Abraham]].

The word that is translated with "[[Strongs/H7136\|good speed]]", or "[[Strongs/H7136\|success]]" in other translations, is the word "[[Strongs/H7136\|q훮r창]]". It means "right place, right time".

You can be immensely smart and intelligent, but only [[People/God\|God]] can give you success by making sure you are in the right place at the right time.
