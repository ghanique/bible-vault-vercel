The second miracle that [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] did was healing the son of a nobleman. This guy had enough [[Concepts/Faith\|Faith]] that when [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] said: "Go your way, your son lives", that he went his way. When he finally arrives home he learns that, indeed, his son has healed, and that it happened at the very moment that [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] said: "Your son lives". [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] healed his son over a distance. [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] is the [[Notes/Jesus is the Lord of Space\|Lord of Space]].

We live in the United States. Most of our family lives in the Netherlands. Now, if [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] is the [[Notes/Jesus is the Lord of Space\|Lord of Space]], then distance is irrelevant when we pray for the people back home, or if they pray for us.
