Bad things happen to all of us, or at the very least they could. I need that strength when I let [[Concepts/Fear (Afraid)\|Fear]] get the better of me. I need that strength so that I can have that patience and longsuffering. By forcing myself to focus on [[Concepts/Word of God\|God's Word]] and God's [[Concepts/Promise\|Promises]] I found that I can usually muster just enough for the patience and longsuffering. But with [[Concepts/Joy\|Joyfulness]]?
