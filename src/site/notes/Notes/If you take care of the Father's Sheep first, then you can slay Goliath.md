When [[People/Saul (king)\|Saul]] told [[People/David\|David]] that he would not be able to defeat [[People/Goliath\|Goliath]], [[People/David\|David's]] response was that he could, because he has kept *his father's [[Concepts/Sheep\|Sheep]]*.

[[People/Jesus\|He]] saith to him again the second time, [[People/Peter\|Simon]], son of [[People/Jonas\|Jonas]], [[Strongs/G25\|lovest]] thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I [[Strongs/G5368\|love]] thee. He saith unto him, [[Strongs/G4165\|Feed]] my [[Concepts/Sheep\|Sheep]].

After [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] died and rose again, He meets [[People/Peter\|Peter]], asks him if he loves Him, and gives him a commandment (three times, actually): "Feed *my [[Concepts/Sheep\|Sheep]]*."

## Conclusion

Our assignment here on [[Concepts/Earth\|earth]] is to *feed the father's [[Concepts/Sheep\|Sheep]]*. There are two ways to look at it:

- Those [[Concepts/Sheep\|Sheep]] are a hand-full: they are generally stupid (otherwise you wouldn't be their [[Concepts/Shepherd\|Shepherd]]), they wander off and get themselves into trouble. Taking care of them takes a lot of patience, and most of the time you don't have the idea that what you are doing is either effective or efficient. Or,
- You get the *privilege* to not only take care of any [[Concepts/Sheep\|Sheep]], but *the father's [[Concepts/Sheep\|Sheep]]* and to give your live for them. And by doing so you will see many miracles on the way (people generally don't survive attacking [[Concepts/Lion\|lions]] and [[Concepts/Bear\|bears]] and catching them by their beards if they resist), and, when the time is there, you will even be able to defeat your [[People/Goliath\|Goliath]].
