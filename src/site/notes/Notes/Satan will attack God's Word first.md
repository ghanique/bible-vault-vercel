Now the [[Concepts/Snake\|serpent]] was more subtil than any [[Concepts/Animal\|beast]] of the field which the [[People/LORD God\|LORD God]] had made. And he said unto the [[Concepts/Woman\|woman]], Yea, hath [[People/God\|God]] said, Ye shall not eat of every [[Concepts/Tree\|Tree]] of the garden?

The first thing the [[People/Devil\|Devil]] did to seduce [[Concepts/Mankind\|man]], was to make him doubt the [[Concepts/Word of God\|Word of God]]. As long as we do not doubt the [[Concepts/Word of God\|Word]], we have no reason to make different choices.

This is also what you see today: nobody believes that the [[Concepts/Word of God\|Word]] is [[Notes/What is Truth\|True]] anymore. Because we don't believe it is [[Concepts/Truth\|Truth]], we also no longer know what [[Concepts/Truth\|Truth]] is. And because we no longer know what [[Concepts/Truth\|Truth]] is, we even get confused about our genders.
