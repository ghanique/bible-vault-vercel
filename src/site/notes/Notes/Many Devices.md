There are many devices in a [[Concepts/Anybody\|man]]'s heart; Nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.


</div></div>


We are surrounded by an abundance of devices: smartphones, tablets, computers - all part of our everyday live. Globally people devote `38%` to `43%` of their waking hours behind a screen.[^1] With information readily available at our fingertips (quite literally), we can find answers to any question, anywhere, any time. And even if one isn't actively looking for information, social media will ensure that you are exposed to a constant stream of information.

The predicament lies in that we default to relying on what we can see, hear, and touch. But it's not the counsel of all these devices that will stand. Only the counsel of the Lord will.

We do well to recognize that in this constant flow of digital information there is little wisdom and no divine guidance. Only placing our trust in the Lord's counsel will lead us to a fulfilling and purposeful life.
