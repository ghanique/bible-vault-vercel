Now the [[Concepts/Snake\|serpent]] was more subtil than any [[Concepts/Animal\|beast]] of the field which the [[People/LORD God\|LORD God]] had made. And he said unto the [[Concepts/Woman\|woman]], Yea, hath [[People/God\|God]] said, Ye shall not eat of every [[Concepts/Tree\|Tree]] of the garden?

The [[Concepts/Bible\|Bible]] is generally very deliberate in what it says. So if it says something that can be omitted, it's probably for a reason. So why does it say `which the [[LORD God]] has made`? After all, [[People/God\|God]] did create all beasts, didn't He?

The [[People/Devil\|Devil]] realizes that the best way to coerce [[Concepts/Mankind\|man]] into choosing against [[People/God\|God]], is by misusing something that is *from* [[People/God\|God]]. You may be inclined to think that, because something is from [[People/God\|God]], that it cannot be used to persuade you to go against [[People/God\|God]], but it can.
