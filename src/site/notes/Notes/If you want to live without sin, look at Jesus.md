I was told that if you go skiing, that it is really hard to find you path if you look where all the trees are and then try to avoid them, because by looking at the trees your body tends to steer towards them. If, instead, you picture a path before you that goes between the trees, skiing is easy.

The same goes for not sinning. If you continuously try not to [[Concepts/Sin (verb)\|sin]], the very attempt will make you [[Concepts/Sin (verb)\|sin]]. If, however, you look at [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]], you will [[Concepts/Sin (verb)\|sin]] less by accident than you ever did on purpose.

Not sinning is impossible. So is walking on water. As [[People/Peter\|Peter]] was walking on water for as long as he was looking at [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]], we can not [[Concepts/Sin (verb)\|sin]] for as long as we're looking at [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]]. But the moment we start looking at the wind and the waves (or the things we do wrong), we will sink.
