And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the [[Concepts/Raven\|Raven]]s to feed thee there.

> I *have* commanded the ravens to feed thee there.

[[People/God\|God]] didn't give [[People/Elijah\|Elijah]] a GPS position. The direction is: "Go east" which gives *lots* of room for interpretation. Likewise, if you receive a [[Concepts/Word of God\|Word from God]], it may give some direction, but it may not be really clear. So how do you know if you are where [[People/God\|God]] told you to go?

Simple. There will be provisions there. [[People/Elijah\|Elijah]] knew he was at the right spot when there was a pile of food, because [[People/God\|God]] *had* already commanded the ravens.
