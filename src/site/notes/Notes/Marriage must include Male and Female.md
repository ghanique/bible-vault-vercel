## Introduction

This part of the [[Concepts/Bible\|Scripture]] is talking about divorce. So by definition it is also talking about [[Concepts/Marriage\|Marriage]].

When the Pharisees asked [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] if it was legal to divorce your [[Concepts/Wife\|wife]], [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] responded with "What does [[People/Moses\|Moses]] command you?". By using both "[[People/Moses\|Moses]]" and "[[Concepts/Law\|Commandments]]" [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] shifts the conversation to the [[Concepts/Torah\|Torah]],[^1] because in that time "the [[Concepts/Law\|Commandments]] of [[People/Moses\|Moses]]" was synonym to the [[Concepts/Torah\|Torah]].[^2]

The Pharisees chose to answer from the [[Concepts/Torah\|Torah]], which allows [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] to do the same. So after they answer that the [[Concepts/Torah\|Torah]] says that a [[Concepts/Man (Person)\|man]] can write his [[Concepts/Wife\|wife]] a letter of divorce, [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] replies with the beginning of the [[Concepts/Torah\|Torah]], with [[Scripture/KJV/Genesis KJV/Genesis 1 KJV/Genesis 1.27 KJV\|Genesis 1:27]] and [[Scripture/KJV/Genesis KJV/Genesis 2 KJV/Genesis 2.24 KJV\|Genesis 2:24]], to be exact.

After explaining that [[People/Moses\|Moses]] gave that command because [[Concepts/Man (Person)\|men]] did not care for their [[Concepts/Wife\|wives]] like they should, [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] explains why this was not intended from the beginning.

## Jesus answers by explaining the design

[[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] explains why divorce was not intended from the beginning:

and they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.


</div></div>


But what was the question again? Whether or not a divorce was allowed. That question is answered by [[Scripture/KJV/Mark KJV/Mark 10 KJV/Mark 10.7 KJV\|Mark 10:7]] and [[Scripture/KJV/Mark KJV/Mark 10 KJV/Mark 10.8 KJV\|Mark 10:8]]. One does not need [[Scripture/KJV/Mark KJV/Mark 10 KJV/Mark 10.6 KJV\|Mark 10:6]] for that. But [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] adds [[Scripture/KJV/Mark KJV/Mark 10 KJV/Mark 10.6 KJV\|Mark 10:6]] anyway.[^3]

We can draw two conclusions from this:

1. [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] not just answers with whether or not a divorce is allowed, but He answers with the original design of [[Concepts/Marriage\|Marriage]].[^4]
2. Apparently that original design includes a [[Concepts/Male\|Male]] and a [[Concepts/Female\|Female]].

## Only [[Concepts/Male\|Male]] and [[Concepts/Female\|Female]] is relevant to Marriage

In that society [[Concepts/Man (Person)\|men]] were superior to [[Concepts/Woman\|women]] to the point that [[Concepts/Woman\|women]] were all but property. One reason why [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] could have added [[Scripture/KJV/Mark KJV/Mark 10 KJV/Mark 10.6 KJV\|Mark 10:6]] to the mix, is to illustrate that [[Concepts/Man (Person)\|men]] and [[Concepts/Woman\|women]] are equivalent, that both are created in the image of [[People/God\|God]] and that both have an equal part in [[Concepts/Marriage\|Marriage]]. But let's compare [[Scripture/KJV/Mark KJV/Mark 10 KJV/Mark 10.6 KJV\|Mark 10:6]] with [[Scripture/KJV/Genesis KJV/Genesis 1 KJV/Genesis 1.27 KJV\|Genesis 1:27]], which [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] is referring to:

But from the beginning of the creation [[People/God\|God]] made them [[Concepts/Male\|male]] and [[Concepts/Female\|female]].


</div></div>



<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/scripture/kjv/genesis-kjv/genesis-1-kjv/genesis-1-27-kjv/" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



So [[People/God\|God]] created [[Concepts/Anybody\|man]] in his own image, in the image of [[People/God\|God]] created he him; [[Concepts/Male\|male]] and [[Concepts/Female\|female]] created he them.


</div></div>


If [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]]' reason for [[Howto/How to read the Bible/Additions\|Adding]] [[Scripture/KJV/Mark KJV/Mark 10 KJV/Mark 10.6 KJV\|Mark 10:6]] was to indicate that [[Concepts/Man (Person)\|men]] and [[Concepts/Woman\|women]] were equivalent in [[Concepts/Marriage\|Marriage]], then wouldn't it make more sense that He would have cited **all** of [[Scripture/KJV/Genesis KJV/Genesis 1 KJV/Genesis 1.27 KJV\|Genesis 1:27]], and not just part of it? Instead He [[Howto/How to read the Bible/Omissions\|Omits]] the part where both [[Concepts/Male\|Male]] and [[Concepts/Female\|Female]] were created in His image.

Though [[Concepts/Male\|Male]] and [[Concepts/Female\|Female]] both are created in His image, apparently that isn't relevant for [[Concepts/Marriage\|Marriage]]. That leaves that the only the fact that they are [[Concepts/Male\|Male]] and [[Concepts/Female\|Female]] is relevant.

(And why they should not divorce, is because they become one flesh, and [[Concepts/Mankind\|man]] should not separate what [[People/God\|God]] joined together).
