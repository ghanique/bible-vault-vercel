I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, [[Concepts/Holy\|holy]], acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.

And be not conformed to this [[Concepts/Earth\|world]]: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.

It can be a dangerous thing to be willing to do **anything** if you're not able to discern what the **right thing** is: you may go all in into destruction.

I've heard of people that wanted to give their life for [[People/God\|God]], so they prayed for a cancer so that they could be a testimony to the people that would come to their funeral that they were not afraid to die, because they knew where they were going. That may be the "good" will of [[People/God\|God]], but is certainly **NOT** the "acceptable", and "perfect" will of [[People/God\|God]]. [[People/God\|God]] has a plan for your life that is a really, really long book[^1], and this way you'd have accomplished just one chapter of it.

(And think about it: wouldn't your testimony not be much better if you'd *always* overcome **life** instead of **death**?)
