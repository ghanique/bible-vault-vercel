He saith unto him the [[Numbers/Number 3\|third]] time, [[People/Peter\|Simon]], son of [[People/Jonas\|Jonas]], [[Strongs/G5368\|lovest]] thou me? [[People/Peter\|Peter]] was grieved because he said unto him the [[Numbers/Number 3\|third]] time, [[Strongs/G5368\|Lovest]] thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I [[Strongs/G5368\|love]] thee. [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] saith unto him, [[Strongs/G1006\|Feed]] my [[Concepts/Sheep\|Sheep]].

What I never understood about verse 17 is what the significance was about the third time, that made [[People/Peter\|Peter]] be grieved about it ... until you look at what kind of [[Concepts/Love\|Love]] they are talking about. And if you then also take into account that they are using different words for [[Concepts/Feed\|Feed]] as well, then you see that there is an interesting negotiation going one.

| Verse | Request                                    | Response                                   | Proposal                                       | Animal    |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| 15    | [[Strongs/G25\|lovest]] thou more than me, To love, unconditional (agapaō, verb))  | [[Strongs/G5368\|love]], Love, as for a friend (phileō, verb) | [[Strongs/G1006\|Feed]], To let cattle graze (boskō, verb) | [[Concepts/Lamb\|Lamb]]  |
| 16    | [[Strongs/G25\|lovest]], To love, unconditional (agapaō, verb))  | [[Strongs/G5368\|love]], Love, as for a friend (phileō, verb) | [[Strongs/G4165\|Feed]], To tend to cattle, to furnish pasture for food, to nourish, to cherish one's body, to supply the requisites for the soul's need, to shepherd (poimainō, verb) | [[Concepts/Sheep\|Sheep]] |
| 17    | [[Strongs/G5384\|lovest]], Love, as for a friend (phileō, verb) | [[Strongs/G5368\|love]], Love, as for a friend (phileō, verb) | [[Strongs/G1006\|Feed]], To let cattle graze (boskō, verb) | [[Concepts/Sheep\|Sheep]] |

There could be two reasons why [[People/Peter\|Peter]] was grieved when [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] asked him the third time "do you 'Love'" me:

[[People/Peter\|Peter]] denied [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] [[Numbers/Number 3\|three]] times,[^1] so [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] more or less asking him [[Numbers/Number 3\|three]] times if he "loved" him, could have reminded [[People/Peter\|Peter]] of that and increase him feeling [[Concepts/Guilt\|Guilty]]. That is not the most contributing factor to [[People/Peter\|Peter]] getting grieved, because if it were then it would have said "when [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] asked him **a** third time". Then it would have emphasized the significance of the number of questions instead of the question itself. So there has to be something significant with the [[Numbers/Number 3\|third]] question.

And there is. Two times [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] asked: "Do you love me unconditionally"? And two times [[People/Peter\|Peter]] responded: "No, I only love you as a friend". The [[Numbers/Number 3\|third]] time [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] descents to [[People/Peter\|Peter]]'s level: "Do you love me as a friend?".

## Even if you love (phileō) other things, you can still feed lambs

Even if all you can master is to [[Strongs/G5368\|Love (phileō, like a friend)]] [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] _and_ [[Strongs/G5368\|Love]] things besides Him, then **still** you can make sure that [[Concepts/Lamb\|Lambs]] have enough to eat.

## If you can muster phileō, you can do awesome things!

Though [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] asks you if you [[Strongs/G25\|Love Him unconditionally]], if you just [[Strongs/G5368\|Love]] Him like a friend, and there is nothing besides him, not only can you feed [[Concepts/Lamb\|Lambs]], you can feed [[Concepts/Sheep\|Sheep]]. Not only can you let [[Concepts/Sheep\|Sheep]] [[Strongs/G1006\|Graze]], you can actually [[Concepts/Shepherd\|Shepherd]] them.

Why? Because it's not about you. It's about Him.

## Jesus will meet you where you are

Apparently [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] believes [[People/Peter\|Peter]] is capable of [[Strongs/G25\|Loving (agapaō, unconditionally)]] Him, otherwise He wouldn't have asked that question. [[People/Peter\|Peter]], on the other hand, does not believe he can.

[[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] is willing to come down to [[People/Peter\|Peter]]'s level: "Then do you [[Strongs/G5368\|Love me like a friend]]?" That [[People/Peter\|Peter]] can do.

[[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] also meets [[People/Peter\|Peter]] in the middle with what He asks him to do:

- not [[Strongs/G1006\|Graze]] [[Concepts/Lamb\|Lambs]],
- not [[Concepts/Shepherd\|Shepherd]] [[Concepts/Sheep\|Sheep]],
- but [[Strongs/G1006\|Graze]] [[Concepts/Sheep\|Sheep]].

Do you know what's funny? At the end of the day [[People/Peter\|Peter]] is meeting [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]]' highest requests: he [[Strongs/G4165\|Shepherded]] [[Concepts/Sheep\|Sheep]], and not just some, but many.
