Now the [[Concepts/Snake\|serpent]] was more subtil than any [[Concepts/Animal\|beast]] of the field which the [[People/LORD God\|LORD God]] had made. And he said unto the [[Concepts/Woman\|woman]], Yea, hath [[People/God\|God]] said, Ye shall not eat of every [[Concepts/Tree\|Tree]] of the garden?

The [[People/Devil\|Devil]] misquotes [[People/God\|God]]. Here it's pretty obvious: [[People/God\|God]] didn't tell them they were not allowed to eat from every tree, He told them they *were* allowed to eat from every tree (but one). In other cases it's more subtle, like when the [[People/Devil\|Devil]] tempted [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]], where he correctly quoted [[People/God\|God]], but pulled it out of context ([[Scripture/KJV/Matthew KJV/Matthew 4 KJV/Matthew 4.6 KJV\|Matthew 4.6 KJV]]).

Another way how the [[People/Devil\|Devil]] misquotes [[People/God\|God]] is by changing the point of gravity. I.e.: if he would have said: "Did [[People/God\|God]] tell you that you could eat from every tree, except this one?", then they would have realized: "Yeah, we have plenty to eat. Forget about this one."
