Wherefore, as by one [[Concepts/Man (Person)\|man]] [[Concepts/Sin (noun)\|sin]] entered into the [[Concepts/Earth\|world]], and death by [[Concepts/Sin (noun)\|sin]]; and so death passed upon all [[Concepts/Mankind\|men]], for that all have [[Concepts/Sin (verb)\|sinned]]:

There is a difference between the noun "[[Concepts/Sin (noun)\|sin]]" and the verb "[[Concepts/Sin (verb)\|sin]]". We *have* [[Concepts/Sin (noun)\|sin]] (noun) because of one [[Concepts/Man (Person)\|man]] ([[People/Adam\|Adam]]). There is nothing that we did to have it and there was nothing that we could do to not have it. Our *nature* is that we *have* [[Concepts/Sin (noun)\|sin]]. The result of *having* that nature is that we *do* according to that nature. So we *do* [[Concepts/Sin (verb)\|sin]] because we *have* a [[Concepts/Sin (noun)\|sin]] nature, not the other way around. So we [[Concepts/Sin (noun)\|sin]] because we are sinners, we are not sinners because we [[Concepts/Sin (verb)\|sin]].
