> ... thorn in the flesh ...

There is quite some debate about what this "thorn in the flesh" is. Some people use it as evidence that [[People/Paul\|Paul]] had a [[Concepts/Sickness\|sickness]] that he was not [[Concepts/Healing\|Healed]] of. But this is incorrect for multiple reasons.

## It's an expression

The term "a thorn in the flesh" was an expression. One can find it in more places in the bible, i.e.:


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/scripture/kjv/numbers-kjv/numbers-33-kjv/numbers-33-55-kjv/" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.


</div></div>


The expression we use nowadays is "a pain in the neck". Just like that if someone is "a pain in the neck" doesn't mean that he is continuously biting you, neither does "a thorn in the flesh" mean that it is something in your flesh.

## Maybe Persecution

Even if this verse was talking about something physical, then maybe it was talking about [[Concepts/Persecution\|Persecution]], as much of the previous chapter is talking about it:

## It says what it is

This scripture says exactly what it is: a messenger of [[People/Devil\|Satan]]. It's an entity. Considering the previous paragraph it may very well be a demon that enticed people to inflict [[People/Paul\|Paul]].

## "Wounds" and "Sickness" are two different things

So maybe, very maybe, this verse is referring to physical problems. But even then it's talking about inflicted wounds, not about [[Concepts/Sickness\|sickness]].

## Conclusion

[[People/Paul\|Paul]]'s "thorn in the flesh" is not evidence of why [[Concepts/Sickness\|sickness]] is acceptable for a [[Concepts/Christian\|Christian]].
