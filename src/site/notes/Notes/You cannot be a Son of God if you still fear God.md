For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to [[Concepts/Fear (Afraid)\|Fear]]; but ye have received the [[Concepts/Holy Spirit\|Spirit]] of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.

> For you have not received the spirit of bondage **again** to [[Concepts/Fear (Afraid)\|Fear]].

[[Concepts/Mankind\|Man]] used to be afraid that [[People/God\|God]] would punish you if you did something wrong. [[People/Paul\|Paul]] calls that "the spirit of bondage". In the New Covenant we did not again receive that "spirit of bondage to [[Concepts/Fear (Afraid)\|Fear]]" again, but instead we received a different one: the "[[Concepts/Holy Spirit\|Spirit]] of adoption", where we are no longer afraid of [[People/God\|God]], but call him "Daddy".

So, going back to the verses: You can only be a [[Concepts/Son of God (not Jesus)\|Son of God]] if the following two conditions are true:

- You are led by the [[Concepts/Holy Spirit\|Spirit of God]], and
- You are not [[Concepts/Fear (Afraid)\|afraid]] of [[People/God\|God]] if you do something wrong, but instead call Him "Daddy".

That means that if you *are* afraid of [[People/God\|God]] when you do something wrong, that you cannot be a [[Concepts/Son of God (not Jesus)\|Son of God]].
