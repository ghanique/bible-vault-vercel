[[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] feeds [[Numbers/Number 5000\|5000]] *[[Concepts/Man (Person)\|men]]*. There were probably as many [[Concepts/Woman\|women]] and many more children. He feeds them with ...

Why? Because [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] is the [[Notes/Jesus is the Lord of Matter\|Lord of Matter]].

How? Because He doesn't supply according to the economy, or according to what you have in your hand, but according to his riches in glory by Christ [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]].
