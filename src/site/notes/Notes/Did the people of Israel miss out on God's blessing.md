I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.


</div></div>


The people murmured. Instead of [[People/God\|God]] punishing them, he shows [[Concepts/Grace\|Grace]] and provides them with food: they get bread in the morning, and flesh in the evening.

But compare this to [[People/Elijah\|Elijah]], who simply obeyed the [[Concepts/Word of God\|Word of the LORD]]:

And the [[Concepts/Raven\|Raven]]s brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.


</div></div>


He got both bread *and flesh* in the morning, and flesh *and bread* in the evening.

Did the [[Locations/Israel\|Israelites]] miss out on [[People/God\|God]]'s [[Concepts/Blessing\|blessings]] because they murmured? Could they, too, have gotten both bread and flesh, both in the morning and in the evening?
