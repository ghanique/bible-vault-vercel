The first miracle that [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] did was the making of wine at a wedding in [[Locations/Cana\|Cana]]. But the thing is: He didn't just make wine, He made **good** wine.

The only way to get from *just* wine to *good* wine is to let it age properly. Really good wine must be aged several decades. But [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] made it in just a few moments. [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] compressed *time*. [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] is the [[Notes/Jesus is the Lord of Time\|Lord of Time]].

And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.
