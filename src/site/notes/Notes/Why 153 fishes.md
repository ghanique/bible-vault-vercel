[[People/Peter\|Simon Peter]] went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, [[Numbers/Number 153\|an hundred and fifty and three]]: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.

The [[Concepts/Bible\|Bible]] could just not have mentioned a number like in [[Scripture/KJV/Luke KJV/Luke 5 KJV/Luke 5.6 KJV\|Luke 5.6 KJV]][^1], or it could have said: "about 150". But it doesn't. It specifically mentions `153`. Why?

## 153

[[People/Augustine\|Augustine]] noted that `153` is a triangular number:[^2] 

> 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13+14+15+16+17=153

At the time it was believed there were only `153` species of [[Concepts/Fish\|Fish]].[^3][^4]

## Fishers of men

At the beginning of His ministry, [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] promised that He would make the [[Concepts/Apostle\|Apostle]]s [[Concepts/Fisherman\|Fishers of men]].[^5]. **Together** they will catch them **all**.

Or, just like they caught every species of [[Concepts/Fish\|Fish]], they will catch every species of [[Concepts/Mankind\|man]].

And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of [[Concepts/Fish\|fishes]]: and their net brake.
