And [[People/Elijah\|Elijah]] the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of [[Locations/Gilead\|Gilead]], said unto [[People/Ahab\|Ahab]], As the LORD God of [[Locations/Israel\|Israel]] liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.


</div></div>


> before whom I stand

The only reason why [[People/Elijah\|Elijah]] had the *authority* to do what he did (make the rain stop), is because there is Someone Who has [[People/Elijah\|Elijah]]'s back, Who is  far greater than [[People/Elijah\|Elijah]].
