When [[People/Jesus\|he]] had heard therefore that [[People/Lazarus\|he]] was [[Concepts/Sickness\|sick]], he abode two days still in the same place where he was.

[[People/Lazarus\|Lazarus]] is dying and they send word to [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]]. One would expect that He would immediately go to them, but He does not. Quite the opposite: He changes his plans and stays two more days where He was.

WHY?!? Because He loved them... Because He loved them, therefore He abode two more days in the same place where He was, when He heard that [[People/Lazarus\|Lazarus]] was sick...

Sometimes [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] will not solve your problem immediately **because** He loves you.
