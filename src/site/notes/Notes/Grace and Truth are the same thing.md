> [[Concepts/Grace\|grace]] and [[Concepts/Truth\|truth]] **came**

The word that is translated with "came" is the Greek verb "ἐγένετο" (egeneto). The tense of that verb is:

- Aorist tense
- Indicative mood
- Third person **singular** form of the verb "γίνομαι" (ginomai).

In English one would think that **two** things came, but in the Greek it's just **one** thing. In other words: [[Concepts/Grace\|Grace]] and [[Concepts/Truth\|Truth]] are the **same thing**.

This has a lot of implications on verses that either talk about [[Concepts/Grace\|Grace]] and [[Concepts/Truth\|Truth]]:
