What [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] achieved on the cross is amazing!

- It's not just great, it is exceedingly great!
- It is as great as what it took to raise [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] from the dead.
- It is far above _all_ principalities, _all_ power, _all_ might, and _all_ dominion.
- And if it has been given a name, it's above that, too.
- It's not just above those things, it is _far_ above those things.
- And it not only so in this world, but also in the future world.
- _All_ things have been put under His feet.

And to top it off: we inherited this!

Now the problem is that we go look for this power externally: from someone praying for us, or directly from [[People/God\|God]], where we wait for Him to go and do something. But all He achieved is **in the saints**. Now, if someone tells me that the thing I'm looking for is in the kitchen, then it doesn't make sense to go and look for it in the bedroom, does it? So why do we look for this power everywhere but where the [[Concepts/Word of God\|Word]] says where it is?

That's why [[People/Paul\|Paul]] is not praying that we will receive when we ask for it. What he is praying for is that the eyes of our understanding will be enlightened, so that we may know that the inheritance is **in us**.

And how do we get to understand this? Through the [[Concepts/Holy Spirit\|Spirit]] that He has given us, who provides wisdom and revelation. Through the [[Concepts/Holy Spirit\|Spirit]], because the inheritance is [[Concepts/Spiritual\|spiritual]]. He can help us understand that we have been blessed with _all_ [[Concepts/Spiritual\|spiritual]] [[Concepts/Blessing\|blessings]].[^1]
