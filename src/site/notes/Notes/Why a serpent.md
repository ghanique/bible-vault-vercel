Now the [[Concepts/Snake\|serpent]] was more subtil than any [[Concepts/Animal\|beast]] of the field which the [[People/LORD God\|LORD God]] had made. And he said unto the [[Concepts/Woman\|woman]], Yea, hath [[People/God\|God]] said, Ye shall not eat of every [[Concepts/Tree\|Tree]] of the garden?


</div></div>


Why did the [[People/Devil\|Devil]] not use a lion? Or one of those big ferocious dinosaurs that probably was still roaming the [[Concepts/Earth\|earth]]? Because he knew that no amount of force could coerce [[Concepts/Mankind\|man]] into choosing against [[People/God\|God]].

(Also I think that the devil either would not be allowed to exert that amount of force, or that it wouldn't be imputed onto [[Concepts/Mankind\|man]] if they didn't have a choice - I mean, the very reason for the tree to exist is to give [[Concepts/Mankind\|man]] a choice).
