> And of his fulness **have** we all received

This verse is from the first chapter of the book of [[People/John\|John]]. [[People/Jesus\|Jesus]] hasn't even picked his [[Concepts/Apostle\|Apostles]] yet. But already John says that we **have** all received.

How often are we **waiting** to receive something? Here it says we already **have** received it. So if you are waiting to receive something you already have, then you are waiting for an event that will never happen. Instead of waiting for something you already have, start looking where it is.
