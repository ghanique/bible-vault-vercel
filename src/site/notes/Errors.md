This document should contain errors, like books that don't have certain fields set, or that belong to both the old and new testament, chapters that don't have some things set, etc.

## Books that do not have Old and New Testament set correctly

When adding a new Book the template assigns it to both the Old and New Testament. It's up to the author to remove one of them. If he did not do that correctly, then that's an error. If he removed both of them, that isn't good, either.

## Chapters that do not relate to Books

Every Chapter should relate to a Book. When the Chapter is created, the user should change the value of `book`. If he doesn't, or doesn't do it correctly, then the link is broken.

## Uses of ambiguous words

Some words are ambiguous. I.e.: "Saul" could mean King Saul or Saul who later became Paul. Wherever ambiguous words are used, the specific ones should be used instead.
